I am a recent Information Systems graduate from the prestigious University of Maryland. With over six years of professional experience in the industry, I have worked across almost all the phases of the software development lifecycle application.

"Data is the hidden treasure of our digital age, full of insights waiting to be unlocked!"

I love bringing data to life in innovative ways. My journey into the data world began in 2015 when I started experimenting with data sets 
for fun. This initial curiosity sparked a passion for 
uncovering hidden patterns and insights, guiding me through the fascinating world of machine learning and AI. Each project, from predictive 
modeling to AI-driven solutions, has been a step toward mastering the art of turning data into actionable knowledge.

Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at [a multinational IT services & consulting company](https://www.tcs.com/), [a space start-up](https://www.pixxel.space/) and [an educational institution](https://extension.umd.edu/node/1/).
