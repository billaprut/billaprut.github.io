I love bringing data to life in innovative ways. My journey into the data world began in 2015 when I started experimenting with data sets 
for fun — it turns out that analyzing trends opened my eyes to the power of Python and R! This initial curiosity sparked a passion for 
uncovering hidden patterns and insights, guiding me through the fascinating world of machine learning and AI. Each project, from predictive 
modeling to AI-driven solutions, has been a step toward mastering the art of turning data into actionable knowledge.

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at [a multinational IT services & consulting company](https://www.tcs.com/), [a space start-up](https://www.pixxel.space/) and [an educational institution](https://extension.umd.edu/node/1/).

I also recently launched a [web application](https://pbilla.pythonanywhere.com/) that predicts the booking rate of Airbnb listings.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
